# TO BE USED TO INSERT MODEL ANNOTATIONS IN METABOLIC ATLAS DATABASE
# for METABOLITE ONLY
# annotations will be visible in the GEM browser pages and some can be used by the search engine
#
# some rules:
# this is a TAB separated file, thus TABs are not allowed in any field values
# each line added must have exactly 11 columns to be parsed properly
# do not modify the @ line
# column 'id' is mandatory, other columns are optional
# follow the max size limits
#
# columns description:
# column name    | max size | description
# -----------------------------------------
# alt_name1      | 255      | long name or full name of the metabolite (note: if 'malate' is the name, malate[c] is already stored in the db, do not re-specify it in this file)
# alt_name2      | 255      | another commonly used name for the metabolite, if any
# aliases        | 2000     | list of aliases, semicolon separated values
# formula        | 255      | the formula, use [a-Z], [0-9], [+-] characters only. Formulas are automatically fetched from the YAML file.
# description    | -        | full description of the metabolite
# function       | 3000     | some text about the function, can describe multiple functions
# charge         | float    | charge, numeric value only. Charges are automatically fetched from the YAML file.
# mass           | float    | mass in g/mol, numeric value only (without the unit)
# mass_avg       | float    | mass in g/mol, numeric value only (without the unit)
# inchi          | 255      | inchi code
