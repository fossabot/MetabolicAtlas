# this is a TAB separated file, thus TABs are not allowed in any field values
# each line added must have exactly 2 columns to be parsed properly
# do not modify the @ line
# column 'id' is mandatory, other columns are optional
# follow the max size limits
#
# columns description:
# column name   | max size | description
